Homework 4 Problem 4 Makefile

A text file describing what tests you ran.
I entered all the described tests in the directions. I used a few macros 
on the repetitive 
statements. I used the .tests: testq testt testv. after every time I 
compiled the code. 

I next moved onto the -x extraction option.  

testxall:
This test gave me the ability to alter the 1.txt file after adding it to 
the archive. Then I 
added the change 1.txt file to the archive. This tested the ability to 
extract only the first found
file and also see if the text in 1.txt was change. 

testx2:
This was as similar test to textxall. I added two text files to the 
archive and have the ability to 
change the text in them. Next I extracted 2.txt and ran pico to see the 
changes in both files.

testd1:
This was my favorite test, it tested the deletion option.  I added 1.txt 
to the archive and sent the 
results 1.ar text to a text file. Then I added another text file, deleted 
it and wrote the contents 
of 1.ar to another text file. Then I ran diff on the two text files to see 
if they matched.

testd1:
This test was similar to testd1, except it tested the first file found 
concept. 

testdm1:
This was just my first attempt at making a test for first file found for 
the -d option.

copy:
I just used this to move the executable to another folder to manually test 
the -A option.
