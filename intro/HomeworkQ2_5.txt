2. What are revision control systems? They are applications that are used 
manage changes in files, code or documents.
Why are they useful? They enables one or many people to easily make edits 
to source code of computer programs or websites without having to worry 
about overwriting each others edits.. .  It offers the ability to notice 
conflicting edits in files and has the ability to merge these documents. 
They also give the user the ability to fork an existing code base and 
evolve it into a new direction. 
Name 4 examples:
Git, Subversion, CVS, Bazaar

Name three common commands that the above RCSs use:
checkout: used to export the code repository to your local machine
add: adds a new file from local machine into code repository
commit: used to commit your code changes to the repository

3. Describe the difference between redirection and piping on Unix. 
Redirection: instead of the output of a command being displayed on the 
screen (STDOUT), redirection ( > )  redirects the output somewhere else 
(examples: would be to a text file or a directory)
Piping ( | ): sends the result of the first command/utility to the second
command/utility

The main difference is that redirection just redirects the results before 
hitting standard output to some other output like file and piping takes 
the standard output or stream of data and sends it to another utility.

4.
find /home/ -type f -exec file -b '{}' \;

5. The unix make command is used to compile source code from one 
or multiple files of a project. It does this by searching for a make file 
that lists all the commands and rules for compiling a project.  Make, is 
also intelligent enough to know what files of a program need to be recompiled 
based on changes. Make is  useful because it automates and simplifies the 
compiling process of large programs. It can also speed up the compiling process 
because it only compiles files that are changed..
